      <h3>ABOUT</h3>
      <p>Anna Vlassova is a Glasgow based interdisciplinary artist working in sculpture, performance, video, sound and furniture making.</p>
<p>In June 2019 she graduated from the Sculpture and Environmental Art course at Glasgow School of Art. Prior to this, she completed her art foundation at the Kingston University, London in 2016.</p>
<p>Anna’s practice is centred around the role of the viewer, making work that encourages its audience to interact with, rather than just look. Her work is triggered by how we perceive our body in a space, often using the qualities of the exhibition location itself as a starting point. She is interested in using the made work as a tool to instruct the viewer to notice elements in themselves, others and the space that may have otherwise been overlooked. Using these objects as tools shifts the focus away from the ‘work’ or the ‘objects’ themselves but instead onto us, the viewer, whether alone in the space or with others.</p>
