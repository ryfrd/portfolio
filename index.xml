      <description>Anna Vlassova is a Glasgow based interdisciplinary artist working in sculpture, performance, video, sound and furniture making.
In June 2019 she graduated from the Sculpture and Environmental Art course at Glasgow School of Art. Prior to this, she completed her art foundation at the Kingston University, London in 2016.
Annaâ€™s practice is centred around the role of the viewer, making work that encourages its audience to interact with, rather than just look.</description>
